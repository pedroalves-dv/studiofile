## Next Session — Phase 9.1

**File to read:** `docs/phases/phase-9-analytics-seo.md`

**What gets built:**

- Full `src/lib/utils/seo.ts` implementation
- Structured data / JSON-LD across pages
- Analytics and SEO metadata

---

## Deferred Items

These were intentionally skipped or partially implemented and must be completed before launch.

| Item | Deferred from | Notes |
| ---- | ------------- | ----- |
| `src/lib/utils/seo.ts` full implementation | Phase 1 | Stub only — built in Phase 9 |
| `RelatedProducts` full implementation | Phase 4.4 | ✅ Done in Phase 8 |
| `WishlistContext` full implementation | Phase 2.1 | ✅ Done in Phase 8 |
| `CartContext` full implementation | Phase 2.1 | ✅ Done in Phase 6 |
| Address management UI | Phase 7 | Auth core done; no addresses page in this scaffold |
| Contact form email service (Resend/Postmark) | Phase 4.5 | API route logs only — wire before launch |
| About / founder page real photography | Phase 4.5 | Placeholder divs — replace when assets ready |
| Instagram / Pinterest real handles | Phase 9 | Placeholder URLs in Organization JSON-LD |
| `src/components/shop/` directory | Phase 4 audit | Stray directory (SortSelect, FilterPanel, ProductGrid). Shop/collection pages now import from canonical paths (`search/`, `product/`). `src/components/shop/` can be deleted when safe. |
| `RelatedProducts.tsx` | Phase 4 audit | Fully implemented (spec says stub until Phase 8). Left as-is since it's working code. |

## Known Issues & Gotchas

Issues discovered during development that affect future phases:

- **`removeDiscountCode`** calls `CART_DISCOUNT_CODES_UPDATE` with an empty array — there is no separate remove mutation in Shopify's API.
- **Shopify discount codes** do not throw on invalid codes — they return `discountCodes[].applicable: false`. Check this flag, not a caught error.
- **`redirect()` in Server Actions** throws a special internal error — never wrap it in try/catch. See `customerLogout` in Phase 7.
- **`useSearchParams()` in LoadingBar** requires a Suspense boundary in `layout.tsx` — should already be in place from Phase 2.3.
- **`viewTransitionName`** as inline style requires `as React.CSSProperties` cast — TypeScript does not recognise this property natively.
- **`quantityAvailable`** can be `null` in Shopify when inventory tracking is disabled — treat as unlimited stock, not zero.
- **`ImageZoom`** uses `createPortal` directly into `document.body`, not the `Dialog` component — Dialog has `max-w-md` constraints unsuitable for a fullscreen lightbox.
- **`src/components/ui/SkeletonCard.tsx`** is a stray duplicate — canonical location is `src/components/common/SkeletonCard.tsx`. Shop and collection pages now import from `common/`. The `ui/` copy can be deleted when safe.
- **`src/components/shop/`** is a stray directory containing SortSelect, FilterPanel, ProductGrid. Shop/collection pages now import from canonical paths. `src/components/shop/` can be deleted when safe (search/FilterPanel still re-exports from it — fix that when deleting).
- **`VariantSelector.tsx`** now syncs `?variant=` to URL on selection. Initial variant from URL is read by `ProductInfoPanel` — ensure `useSearchParams` is available (wrap in Suspense if SSR issues arise).
